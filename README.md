# Inventory_Generator.R

This program reads a CSV file called "inventory_data.csv" with columns for ProductID, ProductName, StockLevel, SoldUnits, and SaleDate. It calculates the total sales per product, determines stockouts and reorder points, and updates the stock levels based on the reorder points. The updated inventory data is saved as a CSV file named "updated_inventory.csv".
